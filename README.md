## Challenge #3 - Implement Partner Integration of Indoor Kit 

Overview: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/industry/agriculture/sensor-partner-integration-in-azure-farmbeats


#### 1. Enable device integration with FarmBeats

This step creates a client that has access to your Azure FarmBeats instance as the device partner. Generating your Farm Beats partner will provide your with the following:

- Tenant ID
- Client ID
- Client secret
- EventHub connection string

##### Azure Cloud Shell Access

Grant Azure Cloud Shell Access to Farm Beats API deployment (https://<datahub>.azurewebsites.net)

1. Download the [zip file](https://aka.ms/farmbeatspartnerscriptv2), and extract it to your local drive. There will be one file inside the zip file.

2. Sign in to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and go to Azure Active Directory -> App Registrations

3. Click on the App Registration that was created as part of your FarmBeats deployment. It will have the same name as your FarmBeats Datahub.

4. Click on “Expose an API” -> Click “Add a client application” and enter 04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46 and check "Authorize Scope". This will give access to the Azure CLI (Cloud Shell) to perform the below steps.

##### Generate Partner


1. Open Cloud Shell. This option is available on the toolbar in the upper-right corner of the Azure portal.

![cloud shell bar](/images/navigation-bar-1.png)

2. Make sure the environment is set to PowerShell. By default, it's set to Bash.

![cloud shell bar](/images/power-shell-new-1.png)

3. Upload the file from step 1 in your Cloud Shell instance.

![cloud shell bar](/images/power-shell-two-1.png)

4. Go to the directory where the file was uploaded. By default, files get uploaded to the home directory under the username.
Run the following script. The script asks for the Tenant ID which can be obtained from Azure Active Directory -> Overview page.

```bash
./generatePartnerCredentials.ps1
```

5. Follow the onscreen instructions to capture the values for API Endpoint, Tenant ID, Client ID, Client Secret, and EventHub Connection String.

#### 2. Create Device Model and Sensor Models for Indoor Kit

1. Create Sensor Models

##### Example POST Requests

```json
POST /SensorModels

{
   "type":"Digital",
   "productCode":"Grove-Air-Tempurature-001",
   "name":"Grove Air Tempurature",
   "SensorMeasures":[
      {
         "name":"tempurature",
         "dataType":"Double",
         "type":"AmbientTemperature",
         "unit":"Fahrenheit"
      }
   ]
}

```

```json
POST /SensorModels

{
   "id":null,
   "type":"Digital",
   "productCode":"Grove-Soil-Moisture-001",
   "name":"Grove Soil Moisture",
   "SensorMeasures":[
      {
         "name":"reading1",
         "dataType":"Double",
         "type":"SoilMoisture",
         "unit":"Percentage"
      },
      {
         "name":"reading2",
         "dataType":"Double",

   },
   "name":"EastChain - Indoor-M1"
}

```

2. Create Sensor

```json
POST /Sensor

{
   "hardwareId":"580cc355-2da0-42e2-8a01-7bc41d6a3725",
   "sensorModelId":"d6a16fc2-26f0-4b8e-88bf-fb27464a55c9",
   "deviceId":"4e4e02bf-261a-429a-b647-51884b350f25",
   "name":"EastChain - Indoor-M1Grove Soil Moisture"
}

```

#### 4. Add data export in IoT Central to event hub

1. Create event hub
2. Capture the connection string
3. Add export to event hub in IoT Central
    - [IoT Central - How to Export Data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-central/core/howto-export-data)

#### 5. Create Azure Function to transform and forward into FarmBeats Service

See Reference Implementation:
